# AysnchronousUnitTesting
Worked with Kodeco's - Unit-Testing in iOS - Asynchronous Unit Testing

This transcript summarizes the conclusion of a course section focused on unit testing in iOS development. Key takeaways include:

- ✅ Unit testing both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** code
- ⚠️ Handling complex **error scenarios**
- 🧪 Using **test doubles** (like fakes) to simplify tests and reduce wait times
- 🐛 Test doubles help replicate **hard-to-reproduce bugs**, especially on remote systems
