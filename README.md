# 🧪 Asynchronous Unit Testing in iOS

This repository contains project files and exercises based on the **Asynchronous Unit Testing** section from a [Kodeco](https://www.kodeco.com) (formerly RayWenderlich) course.

## ✅ Highlights

- Writing unit tests for asynchronous operations using `XCTestExpectation`
- Using `XCTWaiter` for reusable async test handling
- Implementing test doubles (e.g. fakes) to isolate and simplify test cases
- Structuring code for testability and handling complex error scenarios

## 📁 Project Structure

- `DogPatch`: A sample app used for demonstrating asynchronous network testing concepts
- `AysnchronousUnitTesting`: Contains test cases and supporting code written as part of the course exercises

## 🚀 Running the Tests

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mananjain0220/AysnchronousUnitTesting.git
2. Open the project in Xcode.

3. Select a test target.

4. Press `Cmd + U` to run all tests.
